## Part A: Usability Evaluation

### 1. Brief Description of Participants

#### a. Description of Participant 1 (NEW)
 - The participant is a male
 - He is 19 years old
 - He is Informatics ITS 2017 student
 - Having good experinece in design

#### b. Description of Participant 2
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

### 2. Evaluation Script (Just like before except first and second instruction)
1. Register new account
2. Login
3. Find class in specific schedule
4. look for absences in certain course
5. Download apk with the highest rate
6. Logout
7. Login with another account

### 4. Feedback and Incidence Analysis

#### OBSERVATION 1
![Prototype Screen 1](https://www.europassitalian.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bravolol-app-screenshot-1-635x1128.png)

 - **Reference**: Provide line-number(s) or time-code(s) referred by feedback/incidence observed on the screen.
 - **Feedback**: Provide feedback (positive or negative) given by the participants, if any.
 - **Incidence**: Critical incidences (breakdowns or problems encountered by the participants) and/or mistakes committed by the participants, if any.
 - **Reason**: Explain the reason for the breakdowns or the negative feedback observed on the screen.
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 1`.
 
#### OBSERVATION 2
